<h1>Research Title : Data Visualization of the Impact of Radical Artificial Intelligence Technology Toward Jobs</h1>
<h2>Development Duration : Approximately 12 months</h2>

### Project Overview
As we know, the use and development of AIs is growing rapidly. Human technology find ways to replace repeatble and non-important jobs to be automated and done by AIs. Technology advancement is something to be desired and proude of but it will also threatened the future job opportunities as AIs continue to grow more powerful. Hence, this project aims to predict the lists of jobs that will be taken by Artificial Intelligence in the year 2030. This project uses 2 datasets which I manage to find from Kaggle.com.
